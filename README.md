## Introduction

Excel 4.0 macro functions are supported in the latest Microsoft Excel program. This Python 3 script is developed to extract the Excel 4.0 macro codes by tracing the function flow without actually executing the code. This script uses an insecure Python module according to Python's website. It is recommended to run this script on a virtual machine.

The new writing style is continuously evolving. This script may not support all the new features/techniques. Hence, bugs are expected. Use it as is. This script will be improved to enhance the stability and functionality. Please feel free to reach out to me if any bugs are found.
